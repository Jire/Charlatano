**From the creators of Abendigo** comes a brand new approach to cheating-- _Charlatano_ can be completely
__stream-proof__, hiding the fact that you're cheating while streaming, and completely bypasses SMAC server-sided
anticheat as well as FaceIT's modified SMAC. Turning off visuals or using a screenshot blocker
(like hypervisor-powered protection against screenshots in Kaspersky) can potentially allow you to play on leagues
like ESEA for weeks or months. _Charlatano_ uses strong humanizing settings that bring the public the next step in
free and open-source cheating software!

**Available Features**
* Works on Danger Zone (battle royale)
* Always-on all-weapon smooth dynamic recoil control system
* Aim bot with humanized aim paths
* Low-FOV "perfect aim" (non-silent)
* Aim assistance mode for professional and high-level players
* Bone trigger
* Reduced flash
* Stream-proof OpenGL overlay with box and skeleton ESP
* Glow ESP (not stream-proof)
* Humanized bunny hop using scroll input
* "Flat" aim bot with traditional linear-regression paths (not safe for use on leagues! use "PathAim" instead)

**Beginner's Guide**

Before doing anything, make sure you have
[Java Development Kit (JDK) 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
or later installed. This is NOT the same thing as the regular Java Runtime (JRE), and you MUST install the JDK
in order to build Charlatano, as well as any other Java software.

The first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.

* Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano)
* Click on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano/releases) tab
* Download the latest release ZIP archive
* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example)
* Make sure you have Java Development Kit 8 or later installed
* Double click on the "_build_" (_build.bat_) script and wait for it to complete

Once those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_
directory, and will in a directory called **Charlatano 1.1.2**.

From within the **Charlatano 1.1.2** directory, you can start the cheat by running
the _"Start Charlatano 1.1.2"_ script.

Before starting the cheat, you should already be spawned in a game with a weapon in hand!

Running _"Start Charlatano 1.1.2"_ script will open a command prompt window, leave it as it is.

Once cheat is started, you can toggle/change settings by making changes to file under **'Charlatano 1.1.2/settings/'**.

After saving the changes go the command prompt which is already open and type **reload** and hit enter.

To close the cheat, type **exit** on the same window and hit enter.
