# Charlatano
_Cheating is but a lifestyle_

**From the creators of Abendigo** comes a brand new approach to cheating-- _Charlatano_ can be completely
__stream-proof__, hiding the fact that you're cheating while streaming, and completely bypasses SMAC server-sided
anticheat as well as FaceIT's modified SMAC. Turning off visuals or using a screenshot blocker
(like hypervisor-powered protection against screenshots in Kaspersky) can potentially allow you to play on leagues
like ESEA for weeks or months. _Charlatano_ uses strong humanizing settings that bring the public the next step in
free and open-source cheating software!

**Beginner's Guide**

Before doing anything, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.

The first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.

* Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano)
* Click on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano/releases) tab
* Download the latest release ZIP archive
* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example)
* Make sure you have Java Development Kit 8 or later installed
* Double click on the "_build_" (_build.bat_) script and wait for it to complete

Once those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_
directory, and will in a directory called **Charlatano 1.0.2**.

From within the **Charlatano 1.0.2** directory, you can start the cheat by running
the _"Start Charlatano 1.0.2"_ script.

Before starting the cheat, you should already be spawned in a game with a weapon in hand!
